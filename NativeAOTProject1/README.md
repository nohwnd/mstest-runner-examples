### NativeAOTProject1

NativeAOTProject1 shows a possible future, where the test framework and the runner are both native AOT compatible and can be published and run as native apps.

The project is a special test project using the core of the new MSTest runner, and a prototype testing framework. The testing framework generates test description using source generators on compile time, and avoids using any Reflection.

Extensibility is achieved by statically registering extension in Program.cs, such as the TRX reporter.

Application is then published with `-p:PublishAOT=true`, to produce a native application, and can be executed to run tests: 

```
PS> cd NativeAOTProject1
PS NativeAOTProject1> dotnet publish -p:PublishAOT=true
